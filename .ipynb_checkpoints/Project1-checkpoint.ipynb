    "## Task Desciption\n",
    "You are provided with an anonymized dataset containing numeric feature variables, the binary target column, and a string ID_code column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to predict the value of `target` column in the test set using either **Logistic Regression** and **SVM**. You are welcome to use **regularizaiton**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## File descriptions\n",
    "- train.csv - the training set (202 columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "- test.csv - the test set. The test set contains some rows which are not included in scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "- The data does not have specific column names. Therefore, you will not know what data is about. \n",
    "- However, you still can do classicaition problem without clustering the training set. **No unsupervised learning techniques in this project**. \n",
    "- There are 202 columns. This means that the key of high accuracy comes from **EDA** and **feature enegineering**. \n",
    "- There are no rules on EDA and Feature Engineering. \n",
    "- On your model, make sure you can reduce the columns at the most of 25%. If we use all columns, we may have high computational cost and getting into bias-variance tradeoff and underfit vs. overfit situations. \n",
    "- The project is out of 100. \n",
    "    - 50 points will come from your EDA and any pre-processing work. \n",
    "    - 30 points will come from your model: Accuracy + overcoming any ML challenges. \n",
    "    - 10 points will come from in-class competition. \n",
    "        - Ranking the accuracy with less features. \n",
    "    - 10 points will come from a report describing your work flow and model evaluations.\n",
    "        - must be submitted in different file (e.g., pdf, docx). \n",
    "        \n",
    "## Recommand Before-Preprocessing\n",
    "- You can split the set from the data distribution. \n",
    "- You can make multiple new data frames by randomly selecting columns. \n",
    "- You can do similar by rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommand Before-training model\n",
    "- Make sure to delete features from supportive reasons. \n",
