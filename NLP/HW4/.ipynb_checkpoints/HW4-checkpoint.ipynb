       "        'immediately after the elopement adelai da ivanovna discerned in a flash that she had no feeling for her husband but contempt the marriage accordingly showed itself in its true colors with extraordinary rapidity although the family accepted the event pretty quickly and apportioned the runaway bride her dowry the husband and wife began to lead a most disorderly life and there were everlasting scenes between them it was said that the young wife showed incomparably more generosity and dignity than fyodor pavlovitch who as is now known got hold of all her money up to twenty five thousand roubles as soon as she received it so that those thousands were lost to her for ever the little village and the rather fine town house which formed part of her dowry he did his utmost for a long time to transfer to his name by means of some deed of conveyance he would probably have succeeded merely from her moral fatigue and desire to get rid of him and from the contempt and loathing he aroused by his persistent and shameless importunity but fortunately adelai da ivanovna s family intervened and circumvented his greediness it is known for a fact that frequent fights took place between the husband and wife but rumor had it that fyodor pavlovitch did not beat his wife but was beaten by her for she was a hot tempered bold dark browed impatient woman possessed of remarkable physical strength finally she left the house and ran away from fyodor pavlovitch with a destitute divinity student leaving mitya a child of three years old in her husband s hands immediately fyodor pavlovitch introduced a regular harem into the house and abandoned himself to orgies of drunkenness in the intervals he used to drive all over the province complaining tearfully to each and all of adelai da ivanovna s having left him going into details too disgraceful for a husband to mention in regard to his own married life what seemed to gratify him and flatter his self love most was to play the ridiculous part of the injured husband and to parade his woes with embellishments',\n",
       "        'one would think that you d got a promotion fyodor pavlovitch you seem so pleased in spite of your sorrow scoffers said to him many even added that he was glad of a new comic part in which to play the buffoon and that it was simply to make it funnier that he pretended to be unaware of his ludicrous position but who knows it may have been simplicity at last he succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway wife the poor woman turned out to be in petersburg where she had gone with her divinity student and where she had thrown herself into a life of complete emancipation fyodor pavlovitch at once began bustling about making preparations to go to petersburg with what object he could not himself have said he would perhaps have really gone but having determined to do so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another bout of reckless drinking and just at that time his wife s family received the news of her death in petersburg she had died quite suddenly in a garret according to one story of typhus or as another version had it of starvation fyodor pavlovitch was drunk when he heard of his wife s death and the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting with joy raising his hands to heaven lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace but others say he wept without restraint like a little child so much so that people were sorry for him in spite of the repulsion he inspired it is quite possible that both versions were true that he rejoiced at his release and at the same time wept for her who released him as a general rule people even the wicked are much more nai ve and simple hearted than we suppose and we ourselves are too',\n",
       "        'you can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and how he would bring up his children his behavior as a father was exactly what might be expected he completely abandoned the child of his marriage with adelai da ivanovna not from malice nor because of his matrimonial grievances but simply because he forgot him while he was wearying every one with his tears and complaints and turning his house into a sink of debauchery a faithful servant of the family grigory took the three year old mitya into his care if he hadn t looked after him there would have been no one even to change the baby s little shirt',\n",
       "        'it happened moreover that the child s relations on his mother s side forgot him too at first his grandfather was no longer living his widow mitya s grandmother had moved to moscow and was seriously ill while his daughters were married so that mitya remained for almost a whole year in old grigory s charge and lived with him in the servant s cottage but if his father had remembered him he could not indeed have been altogether unaware of his existence he would have sent him back to the cottage as the child would only have been in the way of his debaucheries but a cousin of mitya s mother pyotr alexandrovitch miu sov happened to return from paris he lived for many years afterwards abroad but was at that time quite a young man and distinguished among the miu sovs as a man of enlightened ideas and of european culture who had been in the capitals and abroad towards the end of his life he became a liberal of the type common in the forties and fifties in the course of his career he had come into contact with many of the most liberal men of his epoch both in russia and abroad he had known proudhon and bakunin personally and in his declining years was very fond of describing the three days of the paris revolution of february hinting that he himself had almost taken part in the fighting on the barricades this was one of the most grateful recollections of his youth he had an independent property of about a thousand souls to reckon in the old style his splendid estate lay on the outskirts of our little town and bordered on the lands of our famous monastery with which pyotr alexandrovitch began an endless lawsuit almost as soon as he came into the estate concerning the rights of fishing in the river or wood cutting in the forest i don t know exactly which he regarded it as his duty as a citizen and a man of culture to open an attack upon the clericals hearing all about adelai da ivanovna whom he of course remembered and in whom he had at one time been interested and learning of the existence of mitya he intervened in spite of all his youthful indignation and contempt for fyodor pavlovitch he made the latter s acquaintance for the first time and told him directly that he wished to undertake the child s education he used long afterwards to tell as a characteristic touch that when he began to speak of mitya fyodor pavlovitch looked for some time as though he did not understand what child he was talking about and even as though he was surprised to hear that he had a little son in the house the story may have been exaggerated yet it must have been something like the truth',\n",
       "        'fyodor pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting of suddenly playing an unexpected part sometimes without any motive for doing so and even to his own direct disadvantage as for instance in the present case this habit however is characteristic of a very great number of people some of them very clever ones not like fyodor pavlovitch pyotr alexandrovitch carried the business through vigorously and was appointed with fyodor pavlovitch joint guardian of the child who had a small property a house and land left him by his mother mitya did in fact pass into this cousin s keeping but as the latter had no family of his own and after securing the revenues of his estates was in haste to return at once to paris he left the boy in charge of one of his cousins a lady living in moscow it came to pass that settling permanently in paris he too forgot the child especially when the revolution of february broke out making an impression on his mind that he remembered all the rest of his life the moscow lady died and mitya passed into the care of one of her married daughters i believe he changed his home a fourth time later on i won t enlarge upon that now as i shall have much to tell later of fyodor pavlovitch s firstborn and must confine myself now to the most essential facts about him without which i could not begin my story',\n",
       "        'in the first place this mitya or rather dmitri fyodorovitch was the only one of fyodor pavlovitch s three sons who grew up in the belief that he had property and that he would be independent on coming of age he spent an irregular boyhood and youth he did not finish his studies at the gymnasium he got into a military school then went to the caucasus was promoted fought a duel and was degraded to the ranks earned promotion again led a wild life and spent a good deal of money he did not begin to receive any income from fyodor pavlovitch until he came of age and until then got into debt he saw and knew his father fyodor pavlovitch for the first time on coming of age when he visited our neighborhood on purpose to settle with him about his property he seems not to have liked his father he did not stay long with him and made haste to get away having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of money and entering into an agreement for future payments from the estate of the revenues and value of which he was unable a fact worthy of note upon this occasion to get a statement from his father fyodor pavlovitch remarked for the first time then this too should be noted that mitya had a vague and exaggerated idea of his property fyodor pavlovitch was very well satisfied with this as it fell in with his own designs he gathered only that the young man was frivolous unruly of violent passions impatient and dissipated and that if he could only obtain ready money he would be satisfied although only of course for a short time so fyodor pavlovitch began to take advantage of this fact sending him from time to time small doles installments in the end when four years later mitya losing patience came a second time to our little town to settle up once for all with his father it turned out to his amazement that he had nothing that it was difficult to get an account even that he had received the whole value of his property in sums of money from fyodor pavlovitch and was perhaps even in debt to him that by various agreements into which he had of his own desire entered at various previous dates he had no right to expect anything more and so on and so on the young man was overwhelmed suspected deceit and cheating and was almost beside himself and indeed this circumstance led to the catastrophe the account of which forms the subject of my first introductory story or rather the external side of it but before i pass to that story i must say a little of fyodor pavlovitch s other two sons and of their origin',\n",
       "        'very shortly after getting his four year old mitya off his hands fyodor pavlovitch married a second time his second marriage lasted eight years he took this second wife sofya ivanovna also a very young girl from another province where he had gone upon some small piece of business in company with a jew though fyodor pavlovitch was a drunkard and a vicious debauchee he never neglected investing his capital and managed his business affairs very successfully though no doubt not over scrupulously sofya ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure deacon and was left from childhood an orphan without relations she grew up in the house of a general s widow a wealthy old lady of good position who was at once her benefactress and tormentor i do not know the details but i have only heard that the orphan girl a meek and gentle creature was once cut down from a halter in which she was hanging from a nail in the loft so terrible were her sufferings from the caprice and everlasting nagging of this old woman who was apparently not bad hearted but had become an insufferable tyrant through idleness',\n",
       "        'fyodor pavlovitch made her an offer inquiries were made about him and he was refused but again as in his first marriage he proposed an elopement to the orphan girl there is very little doubt that she would not on any account have married him if she had known a little more about him in time but she lived in another province besides what could a little girl of sixteen know about it except that she would be better at the bottom of the river than remaining with her benefactress so the poor child exchanged a benefactress for a benefactor fyodor pavlovitch did not get a penny this time for the general s widow was furious she gave them nothing and cursed them both but he had not reckoned on a dowry what allured him was the remarkable beauty of the innocent girl above all her innocent appearance which had a peculiar attraction for a vicious profligate who had hitherto admired only the coarser types of feminine beauty',\n",
       "        'those innocent eyes slit my soul up like a razor he used to say afterwards with his loathsome snigger in a man so depraved this might of course mean no more than sensual attraction as he had received no dowry with his wife and had so to speak taken her from the halter he did not stand on ceremony with her making her feel that she had wronged him he took advantage of her phenomenal meekness and submissiveness to trample on the elementary decencies of marriage he gathered loose women into his house and carried on orgies of debauchery in his wife s presence to show what a pass things had come to i may mention that grigory the gloomy stupid obstinate argumentative servant who had always hated his first mistress adelai da ivanovna took the side of his new mistress he championed her cause abusing fyodor pavlovitch in a manner little befitting a servant and on one occasion broke up the revels and drove all the disorderly women out of the house in the end this unhappy young woman kept in terror from her childhood fell into that kind of nervous disease which is most frequently found in peasant women who are said to be possessed by devils at times after terrible fits of hysterics she even lost her reason yet she bore fyodor pavlovitch two sons ivan and alexey the eldest in the first year of marriage and the second three years later when she died little alexey was in his fourth year and strange as it seems i know that he remembered his mother all his life like a dream of course at her death almost exactly the same thing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother mitya they were completely forgotten and abandoned by their father they were looked after by the same grigory and lived in his cottage where they were found by the tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother she was still alive and had not all those eight years forgotten the insult done her all that time she was obtaining exact information as to her sofya s manner of life and hearing of her illness and hideous surroundings she declared aloud two or three times to her retainers',\n",
       "        'exactly three months after sofya ivanovna s death the general s widow suddenly appeared in our town and went straight to fyodor pavlovitch s house she spent only half an hour in the town but she did a great deal it was evening fyodor pavlovitch whom she had not seen for those eight years came in to her drunk the story is that instantly upon seeing him without any sort of explanation she gave him two good resounding slaps on the face seized him by a tuft of hair and shook him three times up and down then without a word she went straight to the cottage to the two boys seeing at the first glance that they were unwashed and in dirty linen she promptly gave grigory too a box on the ear and announcing that she would carry off both the children she wrapped them just as they were in a rug put them in the carriage and drove off to her own town grigory accepted the blow like a devoted slave without a word and when he escorted the old lady to her carriage he made her a low bow and pronounced impressively that god would repay her for the orphans you are a blockhead all the same the old lady shouted to him as she drove away',\n",
       "        'fyodor pavlovitch thinking it over decided that it was a good thing and did not refuse the general s widow his formal consent to any proposition in regard to his children s education as for the slaps she had given him he drove all over the town telling the story',\n",
       "        'it happened that the old lady died soon after this but she left the boys in her will a thousand roubles each for their instruction and so that all be spent on them exclusively with the condition that it be so portioned out as to last till they are twenty one for it is more than adequate provision for such children if other people think fit to throw away their money let them i have not read the will myself but i heard there was something queer of the sort very whimsically expressed the principal heir yefim petrovitch polenov the marshal of nobility of the province turned out however to be an honest man writing to fyodor pavlovitch and discerning at once that he could extract nothing from him for his children s education though the latter never directly refused but only procrastinated as he always did in such cases and was indeed at times effusively sentimental yefim petrovitch took a personal interest in the orphans he became especially fond of the younger alexey who lived for a long while as one of his family i beg the reader to note this from the beginning and to yefim petrovitch a man of a generosity and humanity rarely to be met with the young people were more indebted for their education and bringing up than to any one he kept the two thousand roubles left to them by the general s widow intact so that by the time they came of age their portions had been doubled by the accumulation of interest he educated them both at his own expense and certainly spent far more than a thousand roubles upon each of them i won t enter into a detailed account of their boyhood and youth but will only mention a few of the most important events of the elder ivan i will only say that he grew into a somewhat morose and reserved though far from timid boy at ten years old he had realized that they were living not in their own home but on other people s charity and that their father was a man of whom it was disgraceful to speak this boy began very early almost in his infancy so they say at least to show a brilliant and unusual aptitude for learning i don t know precisely why but he left the family of yefim petrovitch when he was hardly thirteen entering a moscow gymnasium and boarding with an experienced and celebrated teacher an old friend of yefim petrovitch ivan used to declare afterwards that this was all due to the ardor for good works of yefim petrovitch who was captivated by the idea that the boy s genius should be trained by a teacher of genius but neither yefim petrovitch nor this teacher was living when the young man finished at the gymnasium and entered the university as yefim petrovitch had made no provision for the payment of the tyrannical old lady s legacy which had grown from one thousand to two it was delayed owing to formalities inevitable in russia and the young man was in great straits for the first two years at the university as he was forced to keep himself all the time he was studying it must be noted that he did not even attempt to communicate with his father perhaps from pride from contempt for him or perhaps from his cool common sense which told him that from such a father he would get no real assistance however that may have been the young man was by no means despondent and succeeded in getting work at first giving sixpenny lessons and afterwards getting paragraphs on street incidents into the newspapers under the signature of eye witness these paragraphs it was said were so interesting and piquant that they were soon taken this alone showed the young man s practical and intellectual superiority over the masses of needy and unfortunate students of both sexes who hang about the offices of the newspapers and journals unable to think of anything better than everlasting entreaties for copying and translations from the french having once got into touch with the editors ivan fyodorovitch always kept up his connection with them and in his latter years at the university he published brilliant reviews of books upon various special subjects so that he became well known in literary circles but only in his last year he suddenly succeeded in attracting the attention of a far wider circle of readers so that a great many people noticed and remembered him it was rather a curious incident when he had just left the university and was preparing to go abroad upon his two thousand roubles ivan fyodorovitch published in one of the more important journals a strange article which attracted general notice on a subject of which he might have been supposed to know nothing as he was a student of natural science the article dealt with a subject which was being debated everywhere at the time the position of the ecclesiastical courts after discussing several opinions on the subject he went on to explain his own view what was most striking about the article was its tone and its unexpected conclusion many of the church party regarded him unquestioningly as on their side and yet not only the secularists but even atheists joined them in their applause finally some sagacious persons opined that the article was nothing but an impudent satirical burlesque i mention this incident particularly because this article penetrated into the famous monastery in our neighborhood where the inmates being particularly interested in the question of the ecclesiastical courts were completely bewildered by it learning the author s name they were interested in his being a native of the town and the son of that fyodor pavlovitch and just then it was that the author himself made his appearance among us',\n",
       "        'why ivan fyodorovitch had come amongst us i remember asking myself at the time with a certain uneasiness this fateful visit which was the first step leading to so many consequences i never fully explained to myself it seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned so proud and apparently so cautious should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father who had ignored him all his life hardly knew him never thought of him and would not under any circumstances have given him money though he was always afraid that his sons ivan and alexey would also come to ask him for it and here the young man was staying in the house of such a father had been living with him for two months and they were on the best possible terms this last fact was a special cause of wonder to many others as well as to me pyotr alexandrovitch miu sov of whom we have spoken already the cousin of fyodor pavlovitch s first wife happened to be in the neighborhood again on a visit to his estate he had come from paris which was his permanent home i remember that he was more surprised than any one when he made the acquaintance of the young man who interested him extremely and with whom he sometimes argued and not without an inner pang compared himself in acquirements',\n",
       "        'he is proud he used to say he will never be in want of pence he has got money enough to go abroad now what does he want here every one can see that he hasn t come for money for his father would never give him any he has no taste for drink and dissipation and yet his father can t do without him they get on so well together',\n",
       "        'that was the truth the young man had an unmistakable influence over his father who positively appeared to be behaving more decently and even seemed at times ready to obey his son though often extremely and even spitefully perverse',\n",
       "        'it was only later that we learned that ivan had come partly at the request of and in the interests of his elder brother dmitri whom he saw for the first time on this very visit though he had before leaving moscow been in correspondence with him about an important matter of more concern to dmitri than himself what that business was the reader will learn fully in due time yet even when i did know of this special circumstance i still felt ivan fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure and thought his visit rather mysterious'],\n",

       "        'one would think that you d got a promotion fyodor pavlovitch you seem so pleased in spite of your sorrow scoffers said to him many even added that he was glad of a new comic part in which to play the buffoon and that it was simply to make it funnier that he pretended to be unaware of his ludicrous position but who knows it may have been simplicity at last he succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway wife the poor woman turned out to be in petersburg where she had gone with her divinity student and where she had thrown herself into a life of complete emancipation fyodor pavlovitch at once began bustling about making preparations to go to petersburg with what object he could not himself have said he would perhaps have really gone but having determined to do so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another bout of reckless drinking and just at that time his wife s family received the news of her death in petersburg she had died quite suddenly in a garret according to one story of typhus or as another version had it of starvation fyodor pavlovitch was drunk when he heard of his wife s death and the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting with joy raising his hands to heaven lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace but others say he wept without restraint like a little child so much so that people were sorry for him in spite of the repulsion he inspired it is quite possible that both versions were true that he rejoiced at his release and at the same time wept for her who released him as a general rule people even the wicked are much more nai ve and simple hearted than we suppose and we ourselves are too',\n",
       "        'you can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and how he would bring up his children his behavior as a father was exactly what might be expected he completely abandoned the child of his marriage with adelai da ivanovna not from malice nor because of his matrimonial grievances but simply because he forgot him while he was wearying every one with his tears and complaints and turning his house into a sink of debauchery a faithful servant of the family grigory took the three year old mitya into his care if he hadn t looked after him there would have been no one even to change the baby s little shirt',\n",
       "        'it happened moreover that the child s relations on his mother s side forgot him too at first his grandfather was no longer living his widow mitya s grandmother had moved to moscow and was seriously ill while his daughters were married so that mitya remained for almost a whole year in old grigory s charge and lived with him in the servant s cottage but if his father had remembered him he could not indeed have been altogether unaware of his existence he would have sent him back to the cottage as the child would only have been in the way of his debaucheries but a cousin of mitya s mother pyotr alexandrovitch miu sov happened to return from paris he lived for many years afterwards abroad but was at that time quite a young man and distinguished among the miu sovs as a man of enlightened ideas and of european culture who had been in the capitals and abroad towards the end of his life he became a liberal of the type common in the forties and fifties in the course of his career he had come into contact with many of the most liberal men of his epoch both in russia and abroad he had known proudhon and bakunin personally and in his declining years was very fond of describing the three days of the paris revolution of february hinting that he himself had almost taken part in the fighting on the barricades this was one of the most grateful recollections of his youth he had an independent property of about a thousand souls to reckon in the old style his splendid estate lay on the outskirts of our little town and bordered on the lands of our famous monastery with which pyotr alexandrovitch began an endless lawsuit almost as soon as he came into the estate concerning the rights of fishing in the river or wood cutting in the forest i don t know exactly which he regarded it as his duty as a citizen and a man of culture to open an attack upon the clericals hearing all about adelai da ivanovna whom he of course remembered and in whom he had at one time been interested and learning of the existence of mitya he intervened in spite of all his youthful indignation and contempt for fyodor pavlovitch he made the latter s acquaintance for the first time and told him directly that he wished to undertake the child s education he used long afterwards to tell as a characteristic touch that when he began to speak of mitya fyodor pavlovitch looked for some time as though he did not understand what child he was talking about and even as though he was surprised to hear that he had a little son in the house the story may have been exaggerated yet it must have been something like the truth',\n",
       "        'fyodor pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting of suddenly playing an unexpected part sometimes without any motive for doing so and even to his own direct disadvantage as for instance in the present case this habit however is characteristic of a very great number of people some of them very clever ones not like fyodor pavlovitch pyotr alexandrovitch carried the business through vigorously and was appointed with fyodor pavlovitch joint guardian of the child who had a small property a house and land left him by his mother mitya did in fact pass into this cousin s keeping but as the latter had no family of his own and after securing the revenues of his estates was in haste to return at once to paris he left the boy in charge of one of his cousins a lady living in moscow it came to pass that settling permanently in paris he too forgot the child especially when the revolution of february broke out making an impression on his mind that he remembered all the rest of his life the moscow lady died and mitya passed into the care of one of her married daughters i believe he changed his home a fourth time later on i won t enlarge upon that now as i shall have much to tell later of fyodor pavlovitch s firstborn and must confine myself now to the most essential facts about him without which i could not begin my story',\n",
       "        'in the first place this mitya or rather dmitri fyodorovitch was the only one of fyodor pavlovitch s three sons who grew up in the belief that he had property and that he would be independent on coming of age he spent an irregular boyhood and youth he did not finish his studies at the gymnasium he got into a military school then went to the caucasus was promoted fought a duel and was degraded to the ranks earned promotion again led a wild life and spent a good deal of money he did not begin to receive any income from fyodor pavlovitch until he came of age and until then got into debt he saw and knew his father fyodor pavlovitch for the first time on coming of age when he visited our neighborhood on purpose to settle with him about his property he seems not to have liked his father he did not stay long with him and made haste to get away having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of money and entering into an agreement for future payments from the estate of the revenues and value of which he was unable a fact worthy of note upon this occasion to get a statement from his father fyodor pavlovitch remarked for the first time then this too should be noted that mitya had a vague and exaggerated idea of his property fyodor pavlovitch was very well satisfied with this as it fell in with his own designs he gathered only that the young man was frivolous unruly of violent passions impatient and dissipated and that if he could only obtain ready money he would be satisfied although only of course for a short time so fyodor pavlovitch began to take advantage of this fact sending him from time to time small doles installments in the end when four years later mitya losing patience came a second time to our little town to settle up once for all with his father it turned out to his amazement that he had nothing that it was difficult to get an account even that he had received the whole value of his property in sums of money from fyodor pavlovitch and was perhaps even in debt to him that by various agreements into which he had of his own desire entered at various previous dates he had no right to expect anything more and so on and so on the young man was overwhelmed suspected deceit and cheating and was almost beside himself and indeed this circumstance led to the catastrophe the account of which forms the subject of my first introductory story or rather the external side of it but before i pass to that story i must say a little of fyodor pavlovitch s other two sons and of their origin'],\n",
