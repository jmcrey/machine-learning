so i went in and tried this , but the only image that appears on the ground of my base is the one checked under the decals section . for clarity , i 'm not talking about the floaty-spinny clan icon . i have that . and in my clan settings , i have the same image chosen for icon ( floaty-spinny ) and decal ( on ground ) , but the decal does not show . but you ’ d never be sure law scholar , and florida senate candidate looking to bring democratic values back to florida . i 'm bob doyel , ama do you think that florida should be a `` shall-issue '' ccw state ? do you believe in nationwide ccw reciprocity ? what is your plan to stop future school shootings ? please be as specific as possible . thank you . only thing i ’ ve learned is that no one cares who you are and that at least 17 people think i should kill my self . so i guess that ’ s a start can ’ t believe dogecoin is part of the bad guys . april 15 at shinkiba it 's a bit unfortunate what happened with her . she was white hot at the end of 2016/start of 2017 with her feud with kairi , developed a lot , in my opinion much of that has to do with being paired with hiroyo , but it went downhill after that . hiroyo 's standing in the joshi scene plus her being a freelancer means she simply wo n't get pinned , so kyona had to take the falls , now hiroyo probably got * way * too strong with her pushes in other promotions and her stardom appearances have gone down in the latter half of 2017 . now kyona had to tag with natsuko and the team was pretty much cannon fodder to get other teams over . i really wish they 'd push her again , she could be a huge asset to stardom . wealthy people should pay higher taxes , and it endorses tax relief for `` middle-class americans '' and for families with children. ” there is a clear trend in the american liberal movement of leveraging government power to provide benefits/social safety net . of course the conversation has moved towards more things being on the table like single payer healthcare or higher minimum wage but the overarching goals are pretty similar . to help out the middle class and working poor by providing benefits . i ’ m not even making a judgement call on whether or not that ’ s good policy . simply pointing out there are clear liberal priorities ( using liberal in the modern american context ) that people like trump and gary johnson oppose . if you ’ re willing to be a police officer you should accept the reality that there is a real possibility you
